## Description

`pyapes` is designed to solve various engineering problems in rectangular grid.

`pyapes` (should be/have) is/has

- Cross-platform
  - Both tested on Mac and Linux (Arch)
  - Windows support is under testing
- GPU acceleration in a structured grid with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org)
  - Use of `torch.Tensor`. User can choose either `torch.device("cpu")` or `torch.device("cuda")`.
- Generically expressed (OpenFOAM-like, human-readable formulation)

  ```python3
  # Set discretizer and solver. *_config should be dictionary
  fdm = FDM(fdm_config)
  solver = Solver(solver_config)

  # Set Fields
  var_i = Field(...)
  var_j = Field(...)
  rhs = Field(...) # or torch.Tensor (shape should match with Field()) or float

  # Construct equation
  dt = 0.01
  var_i.set_dt(dt)
  solver.set_eq(
    fdm.ddt(var_i)
    + fdm.div(var_i, var_j) - fdm.laplacian(c, var_i), var_i)
    == fdm.rhs(var)
  )
  # solve the equation
  solver.solve()
  ```

## Installation

We recommend to use `poetry` to manage all dependencies.

```bash
git clone git@gitlab.ethz.ch:kchung/pyapes.git
cd pyapes
poetry install
```

> Later, `pip` install via pypi.org will be supported.

## Dependencies

- Core dependency
  - `python >= 3.10`
  - `numpy >= 1.21.0`
  - `torch >= 1.10.0`
  - `pyevtk >= 1.2.0`
  - `tensorboard >= 2.7.0`
- Misc dependency (Aesthetic)
  - `tqdm >= 4.62.3`
  - `rich >= 10.12.0`

## Features (Planning)

- GPU enabled computation (using `torch`)
- ~~Finite Volume Method~~ â†’ FDM
  - ~~Support spatial discretization in `FVC` and `FVM` manner~~
    - `Grad`, `Laplacian`, `Div` (`FVM` only)
  - Implicit time integration in `Ddt`
    - The backward Euler and the Crank-Nicolson
  - Flux limiters for advection term: `QUICK` and `Upwind`
  - Immersed body boundary conditions
  - Linear system solvers
    - Supports one or all of Jacobi, Conjugated gradient (CG), CG-Newton, and Gauss-Seidel (need verification) method.
  - Distributed computing
